    * **Experience Mapping:** Evaluate how the candidate's listed work experience (roles, responsibilities) demonstrates the key responsibilities and required qualifications mentioned in the job posting. Provide specific examples from the candidate's experience where possible.
    * **Achievement Mapping:** Select the candidate's accomplishments (from their profile) that are MOST relevant and impactful for THIS specific job posting's responsibilities and requirements.
    * **Soft Skill & Cultural Fit Assessment (Preliminary):** Based on the candidate's listed soft skills and general professional summary, assess potential alignment with the soft skills likely needed for the role (based on Task 1) and any cultural hints inferable from the job posting/company type.
